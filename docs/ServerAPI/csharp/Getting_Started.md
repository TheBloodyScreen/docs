## Getting Started

### Installing .NET Core SDK >= 2.2

.NET Core SDK can be found [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download). You have to install the sdk, the runtime isn't needed.

Check the [community made module](https://github.com/FabianTerhorst/coreclr-module) for more information.

### Create a project with Visual Studio 17 (Windows)

* Go to "File -> New -> Project..." now the Project Wizard should appear.
* In the left column select "Installed -> Visual C# -> .NET Core".
* Now select "Class Library (.NET Core)" and choose "Name", "Location" and the "Solution name".
* To setup the correct NuGet Packages open the Manager under "Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Manage NuGet Packages for Solution..."
* Select Browse, search for AltV.Net and install the packages "AltV.Net", "AltV.Net.Async" and "AltV.Net.Mock"
* Now go to "Project -> {Your Project Name} Properties... -> Build", here you can select the Output path where the dll should be saved.

To get the Resource running on the server, you have to create a "resource.cfg" file. Copy the resource.cfg, AltV.Net.dll and all other dependencied with your resource dll file to altv-server/resources/{YourResourceName}/.
